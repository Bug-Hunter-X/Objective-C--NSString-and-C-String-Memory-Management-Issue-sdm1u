This repository demonstrates a subtle memory management issue in Objective-C related to the interaction between `NSString` and C-style strings.  The `bug.m` file contains code that reproduces the issue, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version. This situation highlights the importance of understanding how Objective-C manages memory, especially when bridging between Objective-C objects and C-style data types.
