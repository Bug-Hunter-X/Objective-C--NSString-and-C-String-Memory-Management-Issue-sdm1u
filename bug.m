In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSString` objects and their interactions with C-style strings.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
char *cString = "Hello, world!";
NSString *objCString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:cString];
NSLog(@"%@", objCString); // This works fine

// ... some code later ...

free(cString); // ERROR!  This will cause a crash if objCString is still in use.
```

The problem lies in freeing `cString` after it's been used to create `objCString`.  `NSString` might retain a copy of the C string internally, meaning that even after freeing `cString`, `objCString` might still be pointing to that deallocated memory. This can lead to unexpected crashes, particularly during memory management operations. This is tricky as it does not always immediately result in a crash.
